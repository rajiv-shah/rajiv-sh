Making a cauliflower curry is satisfying in many ways but when I make cauliflower ‘rice’ this wonderful vegetable becomes even more versatile.

Roughly grate a whole cauliflower and set aside. In a large pan add some olive oil, thinly sliced garlic and thin strips of ginger—sauté for a few minutes. Then add turmeric, coriander seeds, ground cumin, black pepper, salt, cayenne and continue cooking for a minute. Now add the cauliflower ‘rice’. Mix everything well and cook on a gentle heat—stirring occasionally. Check how it tastes and adjust as needed—for me it’s usually the salt or cayenne.

Towards the end of the cooking add apple cider vinegar and other vegetables such as grated carrots, courgettes, cabbage, peas, spinach, kale. If you have made it very spicy you could add some raisins. Vegetables like broccoli or sweet potato should be part cooked separately first. I would steam them.

Cauliflower ‘rice’ is a forgiving dish—it’s very hard to overcook unless you are cooking at the high temperature.

At the very end if you wanted to—you could add some coconut milk. You can take this dish in many different directions. Play around with the ingredients to find your favourite combination.
