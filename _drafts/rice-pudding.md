Arborio rice makes a great pudding that I often eat together with a main meal, the Indian way.

Put some arborio rice to a pan, add enough water to cover it and cook it on a medium heat. You will need to stir it frequently to stop the rice sticking to the pan. As the water reduces and the rice expands add more water but only enough to cover the rice. Keep doing this until the rice gets to a soft mush texture.

Add date powder or your sweetener of choice, cardamon, saffron (heat a tablespoon gently and then place a few strands of saffron on it—once heated transfer the strands to the palm of your hand and let them cool. It should not take long and then crumble the hard strands into the rice). Then add a plant milk at this stage—coconut milk works well and stir well. Cook for a few more minutes and serve.

Sometimes I’ll add raisins—if you do add them while still cooking with the water.

You can garnish the rice with flaked almonds or chopped pistachios.
