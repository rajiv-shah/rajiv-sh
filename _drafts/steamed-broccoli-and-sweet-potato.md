I love this combination for it’s taste, simplicity and how quickly it can be made. It’s hard to beat this if you want a nutritious meal in less than 10 minutes.

Steam chopped sweet potatoes and about halfway add some broccoli. They cook very quickly—so be careful that you do not over steam them and once you get more experienced, it will be second nature. Once done drain the water and leave the vegetables in the pan.

Drizzle some olive oil, apple cider vinegar or lemon juice, salt and black pepper. Toss everything together and serve.

You could add chilli flakes if you want to spice things up. For some extra crunch add pumpkin seeds. You can also replace salt with tamari or substitute the broccoli with sprouting broccoli. You get the idea.

I love eating this dish as is but there is nothing stopping you from combining it with a salad or some rice, quinoa or a bread of some kind.
