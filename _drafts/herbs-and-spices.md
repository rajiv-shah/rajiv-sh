To make your cooking exciting you should use herbs and spices—this is my list:

\- Bay leaf

\- Cardamom

\- Cayenne pepper

\- Chilli flakes

\- Cinnamon sticks

\- Cloves

\- Coriander seeds

\- Flat leaf parsley

\- Fresh coriander

\- Fresh garlic

\- Fresh ginger

\- Fresh rosemary

\- Ground cardamom

\- Ground cinnamon

\- Ground coriander

\- Ground cumin

\- Nigella seeds

\- Oregano

\- Peppercorns

\- Sea salt

\- Smoked paprika

\- Turmeric

They can be combined in many different ways. Start off with a few and see how they work with each other. Salt and ground peppercorns are a solid combination—add some chilli flakes or cayenne to make it spicy.

Experiment with herbs and spices—just as you would with your basic pantry ingredients.
