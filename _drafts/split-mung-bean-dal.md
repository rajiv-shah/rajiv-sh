My favourite is made with split red lentils. I’ve discovered another one that I will make from now on. Split mung bean dal with broccoli.

In a pan steam some broccoli—I used about two heads. Once done you want to purée the broccoli in a blender with some smoked paprika, apple cider vinegar and salt. Set aside while you make the split mung bean dal. You need to blend the broccoli well to use it as part of the sauce for the dal.

Chop onions finely and cook them in olive oil until they soften under a gentle heat. Then add ground cumin, cayenne—if you want something more spicy use chilli flakes. Add a good handful of split mung beans or more depending on how much you want to make. Mix well with the onions for about a minute. Cook this mixture for a couple of minutes—still under a gentle heat.

Add enough water to cover the mung beans and onions. Cover the pan and turn the heat up. Continue cooking until the lentils start to soften a little—you might need to add more water. Add enough to keep the mixture liquid while cooking. You want the lentils to retain their shape and not over cook—keep the heat on medium. Add some chopped fresh tomatoes, turmeric, black pepper and salt at this stage. Taste the dal and check you’re happy with the flavour.

For the last five to ten minutes of cooking stir in the puréed broccoli. Cook until almost done—there should not be much liquid left. There should be enough liquid in the broccoli and mung beans to create a lovely creamy sauce. If you think the mixure is thick add more water. In a seperate pan add a few thin slices of garlic and olive oil. Gently fry the garlic for about minute—add to the dal and mix. Remember it’s your dal—you decide what you want it to taste like.

Your dal is now ready to serve with a flat bread or some salad. I served it with beetroot cress and Italian flat bread.
