title: About

---
I’ve been plant-based for over 22 years. I love making things from food, photography, sewing, skincare to anything that gets me curious.

I’ve been making food for a long time. A happy amateur cook who likes to experiment. I’m not one for recipes and I think they can restrict your creativity. I’ve simplified the range of foods I use on a regular basis and am very comfortable with what I can and cannot do with them. Being simple is key to me.
