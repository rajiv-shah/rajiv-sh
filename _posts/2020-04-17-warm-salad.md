You could use quinoa or couscous for this. Cook either one ( I am assuming you know how to do this) and set aside.

In a large bowl add some finely chopped mint and flat leaf parsley, a grated carrot, diced cucumber, red pepper and some chickpeas.

In a pan add some olive oil and thinly sliced garlic. Gently fry this for a couple of minutes on a low heat. To this add quartered cherry tomatoes and continue to cook until warmed through. Add this to the bowl.

To finish off add some salt, black pepper, smoked paprika and squeeze the juice of a lemon. Mix everything well.

Eat as is or serve with a leafy salad. You could add some yoghurt too.

You could add or replace some things with courgettes, spring onions, spinach, red cabbage, olives, walnuts or almond flakes, raisins, apple cider vinegar.
