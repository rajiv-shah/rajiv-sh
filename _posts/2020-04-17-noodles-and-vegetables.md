I used to make noodles occasionally but recently I’ve been making them more frequently because I came across spelt noodles. They cook well and do not become mushy if left for a while. They hold their shape very well.

There are four parts to the way I make them—the noodles, veg, tofu and the broth.

Add tamari into a small bowl, peanut butter and cayenne—mix well. Add fresh small chunks of fresh tofu and mix with the sauce. Leave for five minutes and then grill each side for a few minutes—set aside

Heat water in a pan for the noodles. In the meantime sauté thinly sliced ginger and a red chilli in coconut oil. After a few minutes add courgettes and red peppers. Once nearly ready make a miso broth—in a small jug full of boiling water add miso paste and nori flakes—mix set aside.

To the pan with the boiling water add noodles—if I’m making noodles for more than one person I use separate pans for each portion of noodles. Cook for a minute on a low heat and then turn the heat off.

In the serving bowl add chopped pak Choi or kale, strips of carrot, cooked drained noodles, sautéed vegetables, tofu and finally pour the broth into the bowl.

The vegetables are easy to swap out—broccoli, spinach, kale, cabbage, leeks are a few alternatives that come to mind. Use what you like and experiment.
