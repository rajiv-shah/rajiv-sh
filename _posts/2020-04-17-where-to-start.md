From your basic pantry pick two main ingredients—a vegetable and either a lentil, pasta, rice etc… you like and up to three herbs and spices.

You can steam, boil, sauté, bake or a combination to make your food. My two preferred methods are steaming and sautéing. The method/s you use will depend on your preference.
