You can make great tasting soup from a few ingredients quickly.

Cook split mung beans in plenty of water—important, add thin strips of ginger and cook. This will not take long—keep an eye on it. You want the mung beans to cook just enough before they start to go mushy. Add chilli flakes, miso, black pepper and stir. Now add spinach or kale or both and mix into the mung beans. Once wilted the soup is ready to serve.

In a bowl add carrot strips and ladle the soup on top. Add a splash of tamari to finish off.
