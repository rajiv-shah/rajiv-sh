You’ve tried the fried ones and you really like them, so how about baked ones that are super easy to make and healthier !

Eat them on their own, with a pickle, chutney, a tomato salsa, a dip—really with whatever you want.

Preheat the oven to 200ºC 392F Gas 5 and line a baking sheet with baking paper or a silicone mat.

In a large bowl add coarsely grated courgette, red onion cut into slices, large handful of chopped fresh coriander, cayenne, fenugreek seeds, turmeric, cumin seeds, crushed garlic clove, some minced ginger and lemon juice. Mix all the ingredients well. Next add about two cups of gram flour, and with your hands combine everything together. Use only your hands—it’s the easiest way. If you find the mixture too dry add a little water—about a tablespoon at a time. You should have a very thick sticky mixture.

Take a medium handful of the sticky mixture and place it gently on the baking sheet. Carry on doing that with all the remaining mixture. You may need another baking sheet. Bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes—you should not need to turn the bhajis over.

Cool on a wire rack for a short while before serving.

You can vary the ingredients—I’ve made some with red cabbage, peas, apple cider vinegar and coriander seeds—these are my favourites. Lots of flavour and textures. If you don’t like fresh coriander—leave it out or use fresh flat leaf parsley. Play with the ingredients—discover new combinations. That’s the only way you’ll find the one you like.

Another combination I made recently was with leek, courgette, carrot, red pepper, spinach, garlic, ginger, cayenne, turmeric, black pepper, salt, coriander seeds, lemon juice.
