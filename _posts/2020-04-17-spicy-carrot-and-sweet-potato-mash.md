What was supposed to be a spicy carrot and sweet potato dish—turned out to be mushy sweet potatoes with carrot chunks. The disaster turned out to be one my favourite meals.

Sauté some sliced red onions into a pan and let them soften for a few minutes. Add a medium sized chopped sweet potato, ground cumin—mix and let it cook for about a minute. Add a few chopped carrots, chilli flakes, salt and enough water to cover a quarter of the pan. Cover the pan and cook for five minutes—then stir the mixture and continue cooking. Add more water if need but not too much.

Once the sweet potatoes start to become soft, mix and mash the sweet potatoes thoroughly with a large spoon. All the water that is left will get absorbed once you mash the sweet potatoes. If there is too much water you’ll end up with a soup! And don’t worry about the carrots, they will remain intact—this is if you’ve not overcooked everything.

When ready to serve add lemon juice and coriander—mix.
