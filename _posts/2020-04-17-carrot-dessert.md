Carrots can make a fab simple dessert.

Add a few grated carrots to a pan with coconut oil and slowly cook for a couple of minutes—stirring occasionally. Then add ground cardamom (be careful with adding too much), date powder, raisins and continue cooking until the carrots have softened enough. Check that you’re happy with the sweetness—if not add more date powder. If you feel there is not enough cardamom add a tiny bit more.

Serve in a bowl with coconut milk, cashew or flaked almonds and some coconut flakes. I think it’s best served warm.
