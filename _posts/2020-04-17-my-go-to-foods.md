title: My go to foods

Over the next few chapters, I will describe how I make some of my favourite foods and how you could change them slightly so that you could make them more than once a week if you don’t like eating the same food regularly. For me I enjoy eating the same food again and again because these are the foods I love.

Remember to experiment, start small and try to understand what happens to the ingredients when you cook them: How long do they take to cook? How does the texture of the food change? Can the ingredients only be cooked one way? What happens with certain herb/spice combinations?

I will describe how I make them—these are not recipes, just my ideas. There are no photographs or drawings—you can see some of them on my Twitter feed [@rajivshah](https://twitter.com/rajivshah "@rajivshah")
