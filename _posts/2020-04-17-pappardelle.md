Pappardelle is my favourite pasta but you could use any pasta you like for this.

Ideally you need a good pasta, garlic, salt, black pepper, flat leaf parsley, apple cider vinegar and olive oil.

Cook the pasta until al dente—important! If you over cook it here the texture will be all wrong so better to under cook it. Then run cold water through it until the pasta has cooled down completely and leave it covered with cold water.

Thinly slice garlic and add it to a large pan and gently fry it in olive oil. When it starts to sizzle add the drained pasta to it and gently mix the pasta with the garlic and olive oil. Add some apple cider vinegar and cover the pan with a lid and let the pasta warm up and cook a little. Careful not to cook too much—texture is everything. Half way through add some salt and black pepper and mix again. You need to make sure the pasta does not stick to the pan. Add more olive oil if necessary. For the last minute add some flat leaf parsley and combine it with the pasta.

Check that you’re happy with the seasoning—add more salt and black pepper if needed. Serve with some salad if you want.

This is my favourite way to eat pasta—forget all the sauces etc. I love the simplicity of this dish. You could add olives, some chilli flakes but that’s it. After that it becomes something else.

Use this as a basis to create other pasta dishes but for a very simple quick meal you cannot beat this. You can have this ready in under ten minutes.
